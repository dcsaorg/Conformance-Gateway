At the start of the conformance testing scenario, the DCSA reference implementation of a shipper—operating within the
sandbox environment—needs to interact with your carrier application via API calls to validate conformance. By default,
the DCSA shipper does not have any predefined knowledge of your organization’s data or system configurations.
Therefore, please use the example ebl provided below as a template, and modify the values as necessary to ensure
compatibility with your system.

Make sure the ebl type remains SCENARIO_TYPE.
