    "description": "API specification issued by DCSA.org.\n\nFor explanation to specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model v2023.Q3]() *** _Will be updated_ ***. This API does not define the business rules regarding what is allowed to update at what time. For this the [Electronic Bill of Lading IFS]() *** _Will be updated_ *** should be consulted. **All UseCases mentioned in this API refer to UseCases defined in this EBL IFS**.\n\nAll other documents related to the Electronic Bill of Lading publication can be found [here](https://knowledge.dcsa.org/s/publication?publicationId=a0r7T000000L8lPQAS)\n\nIt is possible to use this API as a standalone API. In order to do so it is necessary to use one of the poll-endPoints:\n\n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}  # For Shipping Instructions status\n    GET /v3/transport-documents/{transportDocumentReference}  # For Transport Document status\n\nin order to poll information about status changes.\n\nIt is possible to have notifications pushed to you whenever the provider needs input and/or a state change. The format for the Notification is defined by the [Electronic Bill of LAding Notification API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1). Signing up for Notifications is defined outside the scope of this API.\n\nFor a changelog please click [here](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/tree/master/ebl/v3#v300B1).

This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**.\n\n## Precondition\nThe consumer has information for a `Shipping Instructions`.\n\n## Postcondition\nThe provider has received the `Shipping Instructions`.\n\nThe consumer will receive a `201` (Created) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.\n\n## Process\nThe following occurs when a provider recieves a `Shipping Instructions`:\n1. The payload (`Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means\n    - all required fields are provided\n    - all values provided have correct data type\n\n   A `shippingInstructionsReference` (as a reference to the `Shipping Instructions`) is created and stored along with the payload in the provider system.\n  \n   **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `si-123` will be used as `shippingInstructionsReference`**\n\n3. A `201` (Created) response is returned with the following payload\n    ```\n    {\n      shippingInstructionsReference: 'si-123',\n      shippingInstructionsStatus: 'RECEIVED'\n    }\n    ```\n4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1#/Notifications/shipping-instructions-notifications).\n\nFor `POST` `Shipping Instructions` the process ends here. The `Shipping Instructions`\n\n  - is now stored in the provider system\n  - has status `RECEIVED`\n  - awaits further processing by the provider\n  - a `201` (Created) response is sent to the consumer with a payload containing `documentStatus=RECEIVED`\n  - '_relevant_' subscribers have been notified\n\nAsynchronious processing will now start by the provider - once processed, the new status of the `Shipping Instructions` will be communicated via a `Shipping Instructions Notification`. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the\n\n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}\n    \n  endPoint in order to check if the `shippingInstructionsStatus` of the `Shipping Instructions` has changed.\n",

This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**\n\nThis endPoint is to be used in response to **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions** in which case `documentStatus='PENDING UPDATE'`. The endPoint can also be used in case `documentStatus='RECEIVED'` and the consumer has an update to the `Shipping Instructions`.\n\n### Precondition\nIn order to update a `Shipping Instructions`, the status of the `Shipping Instructions` needs to be in state\n\n- `RECEIVED` in case the consumer has updated information for the `Shipping Instructions`\n- `PENDING UPDATE` in case the provider has requested the consumer to update the `Shipping Instructions` (a result of **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions**)\n\n## Postcondition\nThe provider has received an update to the `Shipping Instructions` (**UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) - from now on called the `Updated Shipping Instructions`.\n\nThe `Updated Shipping Instructions` and the \"original\" `Shipping Instructions` co-exist until a new update is submitted. The `Updated Shipping Instructions` always represents the latest version of an update received by the provider.\n\nThe consumer will receive a `200` (OK) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.\n\n## Process\nThe following occurs when a provider recieves an **update** to a `Shipping Instructions`\n1. The payload (`Updated Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means\n    - all required fields are provided\n    - all values provided have correct data type\n  \n    The `Updated Shipping Instructions` is stored in the provider system alongside the \"original\" `Shipping Instructions`.\n\n   **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `si-123` will be used as `shippingInstructionsReference`**\n\n3. The response depends on which useCase is the reason for calling this endPoint (what the `shippingInstructionsStatus` is):\n\n    - If `shippingInstructionsStatus` **is** `RECEIVED` then this endPoint is being used in addition to **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**. In this case the consumer would like to make an update to an already sent `Shipping Instructions` - this is done via **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**. The `shippingInstructionsStatus` stays as `RECEIVED`, `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` is set to `UPDATE RECEIVED`\n    \n      A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned\n      ```\n      {\n        shippingInstructionsReference: 'si-123',\n        shippingInstructionsStatus: 'RECEIVED',\n        updatedShippingInstructionsStatus: 'UPDATE RECEIVED'\n      }\n      ```\n\n    - If `shippingInstructionsStatus` is `PENDING UPDATE` then this endPoint is being used as a reponse to **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions** in this case the provider has requested an update to a `Shipping Instructions`. The `shippingInstructionsStatus` stays as `PENDING UPDATE`, `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` is set to `UPDATE RECEIVED`\n      \n      A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned\n      ```\n      {\n        shippingInstructionsReference: 'si-123',\n        shippingInstructionsStatus: 'PENDING UPDATE',\n        updateShippingInstructionsStatus: 'UPDATE RECEIVED'\n      }\n      ```\n4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1#/Notifications/shipping-instructions-notifications).\n\nFor `PUT` `Shipping Instructions` the process ends here. The `Updated Shipping Instructions`\n\n  - is now stored in the provider system\n  - a `200` (OK) response is sent to the consumer with the status of the `Shipping Instructions` and the `Updated Shipping Instructions` with one of the following combinations (depending on the useCase):\n    - `shippingInstructionsStatus='RECEIVED'` and `updateShippingInstructionsStatus='UPDATE RECEIVED'` (if endPoint used to make an update to a Submitted Shipping Instructions - **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**)\n    - `shippingInstructionsStatus='PENDING UPDATE'` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus='UPDATE RECEIVED'` (if endPoint used as a response to **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions**)\n  - '_relevant_' subscribers have been notified\n\nAsynchronious processing will now start by the provider. Once processed, the new status of the `Shipping Instructions` and `Updated Shipping Instructions` will be communicated via a `Shipping Instructions Notification`. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the\n\n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}\n    \n  endPoint in order to check if the `shippingInstructionsStatus` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` of the `Shipping Instructions` has changed.\n  \n  If the consumer wants to get the content of the `Update Shipping Instructions` provided via this `PUT` endPoint,  the `GET` endPoint needs to be used in combination with the `?updatedContent=true` queryParameter\n  \n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}?updatedContent=true\n",
