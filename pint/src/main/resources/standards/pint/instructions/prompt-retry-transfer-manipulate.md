This action retries an electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) transfer by manipulating/modifying the latest transfer chain
entry and then re-signing it in a PINT (Platform Interoperability) scenario.

**What your sending platform should do:**

1. **Load the previous transfer state:** Retrieve the saved transfer state for the transport document reference
2. **Manipulate the latest transaction:** Modify the content of the most recent transfer chain entry (this could include
   changing transaction data, timestamps, or other elements)
3. **Re-sign the modified entry:** Generate new signatures for the manipulated transfer chain entry using your
   platform's signing certificate
4. **Prepare updated payload:** Reconstruct the transfer request with the modified and newly signed entry
5. **Resend with manipulated data:** POST the eBL envelope with the modified transfer chain to the receiving platform

**Request payload includes:**

- `transportDocument`: The same transport document data as the original transfer
- `envelopeManifestSignedContent`: Updated signed envelope manifest reflecting the manipulated transaction
- `envelopeTransferChain`: Transfer chain with the latest entry manipulated and re-signed
- `issuanceManifestSignedContent`: The same signed issuance manifest (if present)

**Expected response:**

- Variable HTTP status code based on the scenario being tested
- May result in validation errors if the manipulation is detected
- Response may include updated `missingAdditionalDocumentChecksums` or error messages
- The receiving platform should validate the modified data appropriately

This tests your platform's ability to modify and re-sign transfer data and the receiving platform's ability to validate
potentially tampered transfers according to PINT interoperability standards.
