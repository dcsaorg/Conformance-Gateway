This action retries an electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) transfer by resending the exact same transfer data without any
modifications in a PINT (Platform Interoperability) scenario.

**What your sending platform should do:**

1. **Load the previous transfer state:** Retrieve the saved transfer state for the transport document reference
2. **Prepare the same payload:** Reconstruct the exact same transfer request as before
3. **Resend without changes:** POST the identical eBL envelope to the receiving platform

**Request payload includes:**

- `transportDocument`: The same transport document data as the original transfer
- `envelopeManifestSignedContent`: The same signed envelope manifest from the previous attempt
- `envelopeTransferChain`: The identical transfer chain entries
- `issuanceManifestSignedContent`: The same signed issuance manifest (if present)

**Expected response:**

- Variable HTTP status code based on the scenario being tested
- Response may include updated `missingAdditionalDocumentChecksums` if additional documents are still required
- The receiving platform should handle the retry appropriately

This tests your platform's ability to properly retry failed transfers and the receiving platform's ability to handle
retry scenarios according to PINT interoperability standards.
