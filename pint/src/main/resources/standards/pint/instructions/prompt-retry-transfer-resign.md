This action retries an electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) transfer by re-signing the latest transfer chain entry with fresh
signatures in a PINT (Platform Interoperability) scenario.

**What your sending platform should do:**

1. **Load the previous transfer state:** Retrieve the saved transfer state for the transport document reference
2. **Re-sign the latest entry:** Generate new signatures for the most recent transfer chain entry using your platform's
   signing certificate
3. **Prepare updated payload:** Reconstruct the transfer request with the newly signed entry
4. **Resend with fresh signatures:** POST the eBL envelope with updated signatures to the receiving platform

**Request payload includes:**

- `transportDocument`: The same transport document data as the original transfer
- `envelopeManifestSignedContent`: Updated signed envelope manifest with fresh signatures
- `envelopeTransferChain`: Transfer chain with the latest entry re-signed
- `issuanceManifestSignedContent`: The same signed issuance manifest (if present)

**Expected response:**

- Variable HTTP status code based on the scenario being tested
- Response may include updated `missingAdditionalDocumentChecksums` if additional documents are still required
- The receiving platform should validate the fresh signatures appropriately


This tests your platform's ability to re-sign transfer data and the receiving platform's ability to validate renewed
signatures according to PINT interoperability standards.
